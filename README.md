# clusteringAlgorithmFromScratch

1. Clustering is an unsupervised learning algoriths
2. In this repository I have K-Means clustering
3. The mimic or the algorithm has been built on 2 d datapoints
4. We are categorizing weather data into 3 clusters

*The step by step process has been showed for the data set*

Step1: We will choose arbitrary points as centeroid
Step2: Identify the closest centeroid to all the data points
Step3: Do the classification
Step4: Calcuate the new centeroid based on the classified cluster
Step5: Repeat step3, step4 and step5 until the centeroid position does not change
